After you install the HPE ALM Octane CI plugin, configure the plugin to connect to ALM Octane.


### Configuring the Bamboo plugin to connect to ALM Octane 
#### Before you configure the connection: 
1. Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when
communicating with ALM Octane. The access keys must be assigned the CI/CD Integration role in all relevant workspaces. For details, see Set up API access for integration.
2. To enable the Bamboo server to communicate with ALM Octane, make sure the server can access the Internet. If your network requires a proxy to connect to the Internet, setup the required proxy configuration. 
3. Decide which Bamboo user ALM Octane will use to execute jobs on the server.

**Caution: We strongly recommend setting this user’s permissions to the minimum required for this integration:  Build plan permissions.**

####Configure the connection
To instruct the plugin to connect to ALM Octane, navigate to the HPE ALM Octane CI Plugin entry in the COMMUNICATION section in bamboo system administration.

Enter the following information:
 
**Location**: http:// Octane fully qualified domain name / IP address> {:}/ui/?p= 
For example, in this URL, the shared space ID is 1002:  http://myServer.myCompany.com:8081/ui/?p=1002
 
**Client ID/Secret**: Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when communicating with ALM Octane
 
**Bamboo user**: admin - account that will run jobs for ALM Octane (must have build plan permissions)

**After the connection is set up**, open ALM Octane, define a CI server and create pipelines.
